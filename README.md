# Question: How can you generate all valid combinations of n pairs of parentheses? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided is a solution to generate all valid combinations of n pairs of parentheses. It uses a recursive approach to solve the problem. The main function, `generateParenthesis`, initializes an empty array `result` to store the valid combinations, and then calls the helper function `backtrack`. The `backtrack` function is designed to add an open parenthesis if the number of open parentheses is less than the maximum limit, and to add a close parenthesis if the number of close parentheses is less than the number of open parentheses. This ensures that the parentheses are always balanced. The function continues to add parentheses to the current string until its length is twice the maximum limit, which indicates that the maximum number of pairs of parentheses has been reached. At this point, the current string is added to the `result` array. The process is repeated until all valid combinations are generated. The `generateParenthesis` function then returns the `result` array, which contains all the valid combinations of n pairs of parentheses.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution solves the problem in a similar way to the JavaScript version. Both versions use recursion and the same logic to generate all valid combinations of n pairs of parentheses. 

However, there are some differences in the language features and methods used in the TypeScript version:

1. TypeScript uses static types: In the TypeScript version, types are specified for function parameters and return values. For example, the `generateParenthesis` function is explicitly declared to take a number as an argument and return an array of strings. This can help prevent bugs and improve code readability.

2. TypeScript uses classes: The TypeScript solution is encapsulated within a class called `ParenthesesGenerator`. This class has two methods: `generateParenthesis` and `backtrack`. The `backtrack` method is marked as private, which means it can only be accessed within the `ParenthesesGenerator` class. This is a feature of TypeScript's support for object-oriented programming.

3. TypeScript uses `let` for variable declaration: Unlike JavaScript, which uses `var`, TypeScript uses `let` for variable declaration. This provides block scope rather than function scope, which can help prevent bugs related to variable hoisting.

Overall, the TypeScript version provides better type safety and encapsulation, which can make the code easier to understand and maintain.

# C++ Differences

Both the JavaScript and C++ versions solve the problem using a similar approach: they use recursion to generate all possible combinations of parentheses, and they keep track of the number of open and close parentheses to ensure that the combinations are valid. 

However, there are some differences in the language features and methods used in the two versions:

1. Data Types: In JavaScript, an array is used to store the results, while in C++, a vector is used. This is because JavaScript does not have a built-in vector data type like C++. 

2. Function Parameters: In the JavaScript version, the current string and the counts of open and close parentheses are passed as parameters to the recursive function. In the C++ version, these are also passed as parameters, but in addition, the result vector is passed by reference. This is because C++ functions cannot return multiple values or modify their arguments unless they are passed by reference or pointer.

3. Input/Output: The JavaScript version hard-codes the number of pairs of parentheses and logs the results to the console. The C++ version, on the other hand, prompts the user for the number of pairs and prints each result on a new line. This is done using the iostream library, which provides functions for input/output operations.

4. String Concatenation: In JavaScript, the '+' operator is used to concatenate strings. In C++, the same operator is used, but it's worth noting that this operation can be more expensive in C++ as it can potentially involve creating a new string and copying the contents of the old strings into it.

5. Iteration: In the JavaScript version, the results are logged to the console directly from the generateParenthesis function. In the C++ version, the results are returned to the main function, which then iterates over them using a range-based for loop to print them out. This is a feature of C++ that allows for easy iteration over collections.
